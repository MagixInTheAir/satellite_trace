# SATELLITE PATH TRACER

This repository regroups my work for a class of first year engineering school. We were task to trace the path of a satellite from its orbital parameters. 

## Features

- Trace a path from orbital parameters
- Animate the satellite evolution in real-time or at a specified rate
- View full position tables over time

## Improvements

Please feel free to open a pull request for any additional feature or request it in an issue. A good improvement would be to switch to OpenStreetMaps.
